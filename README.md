This is the github which we will be using for our team project. If you have made any changes, please add a small summary in the notion along with the next steps needed to be done.

There should also be a mind-map explaining the branches and how the code would interact with each other, ensuring that the work that is being done matches the mindmap. This will ensure that the front-end and back-end are connected as they are supposed to be.

Throughout the code, write written notes of what each couple of lines of code is doing. This will help with understnading the code as well as finding any potenatil erros later on.
