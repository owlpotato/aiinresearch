This is the github which we will be using for our team project. If you have made any changes, please add a small summary in the notion along with the next steps needed to be done.

There should also be a mind-map explaining the branches and how the code would interact with each other, ensuring that the work that is being done matches the mindmap. This will ensure that the front-end and back-end are connected as they are supposed to be.
